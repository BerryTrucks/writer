# About

This is the source code of my app Writer for BlackBerry 10. The app brings a distraction free writing environment to BlackBerry 10 devices. It is built with C++ and QML, with a little Javascript.

I wrote this app in 2013. In 2015, I wrote Compose, an advanced version of Writer, and made Writer free.

It is free to download at [BlackBerry World](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/33698893/).
